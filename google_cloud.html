Certifications

Different Tracks in Google Cloud. Each track has a separate certification. 

    Proof is better than argument. Because GCP certification is difficult it has value. 
    Coursera certification vs Google Cloud Certification. Only Google Cloud Certification has value not coursera certification.

Certification Preparation Suggestions

    Coursera Courses + Qwiklabs + Documentation is enough
    Product knowledge. The best source for it is, documentation of that product
    Conceptual Understanding of Product
    No syntax or coding questions, mostly case study/scenario driven


Certification Exam Suggestions

    Read the complete question very carefully
        Missing an important word might lead to choosing wrong answer
    Don't assume more than what is given in the question
    Read all the answers very carefully
        Can eliminate answers by a few keywords in answers. Generally can easily eliminate at least 2. 
    After elimination
        If you are confused between final two choices after elimination, then read the question again more carefully & finalise answer from remaining options
        If still confused mark the question for review and revisit it towards the end
